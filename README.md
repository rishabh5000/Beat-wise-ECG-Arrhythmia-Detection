# Beat-wise-ECG-Arrhythmia-Detection
Beat-wise ECG Arrhythmia Detection using Deep Learning Designed a high-precision heartbeat classification pipeline on the MIT-BIH dataset by extracting R-peak segments and transforming 110,000+ beats into 64Ã—64 GAF images. Built and compared both custom CNN and ResNet models, handling class imbalance with augmentation and adaptive loss weighting.
